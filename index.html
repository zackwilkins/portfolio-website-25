                        Originaly From Seattle, Zack fell in love with the outdoors at an early age
                        competing in cross country races from as early as elementary school. As he 
                        got older the races kept getting further and further. He ran his first half 
                        marathon in high school, and first marathon his freshman year of college in 3 
                        hours 30 minutes. For some reason he decided to run further, and competed in the 
                        DC Peaks 55k in October 2025.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Zack is partly in Utah because he loves skiing, but as any Wasatch skier knows
                        it can snow a foot in one resort, but barely a trace at another. He created a 
                        snowfall tracker to help navigate that.
