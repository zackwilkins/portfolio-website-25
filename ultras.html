                    <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 34 Miles</p>
                    <p><strong>Elevation Gain:</strong> ~6,000ft (Alt Route)</p>

                    <p><strong>Notes:</strong> First Ultra Ever! While taking a 6 am Lyft ride up to Kaysville, we followed a thunderstorm the whole way up north. It was a sign of things to come with October 4th, 2025, ending up as the 2nd rainiest day in Salt Lake City history. I took 7 hours and 6 minutes to complete the 55k, and it rained the whole time. I'm from Seattle, so I'm used to the rain, but it was the wind that got to me. The Mueller Park section above Bountiful was located at 6,500 ft, 2,000 ft above the valley, and it was in the mid-30s with strong winds. After being wet for hours, this was miserable, but I managed to get through it with the help of the amazing volunteers at the Summerwood Aid Station.</p>
